# Pneumonia_Detection_Using_CXRS_Deep_Learning_Algorithms
 The problem statement is Pneumonia Detection using Chest Xray Images.

It contains models for pneumonia identification based binary classification.The dataset has been taken from kaggle.Six Deep Learning models have been trained which are :-
  CNN
  VGG16
  XCEPTION
  RESNET50
  DENSENET
  MOBILENET
  
  CNN gives the highest accuracy amongst all (92%).Followed by VGG16 and RESNET50 at 89%.
  
  These transfer learning algorithms have been trained by data augmentation,algorithm tuning ,callbacks and prevention of overfitting.
  
  The accuracy graphs were plotted alongwith the loss graphs.
